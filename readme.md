# pyAsteroid

This is a simple porting of the very old Asteroid games in python. I wrote down from scratch using the pyGame library (http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html).

## Game controls
Key A: rotate the battleship in counterclockwise
Key S: rotate the battleship in clockwise
Spacebar: fire a bullet

## Limitations
Now the battleship is only able to rotate and fire a bullet. There is only one asteroid coming from the left (I used it to test the code).
