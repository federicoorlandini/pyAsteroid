# pyAsteroid

This is a simple porting of the very old Asteroid games in python. I wrote down from scratch using the pyGame library (http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html).

## How to Run

### Method 1: From Project Root (Recommended)
```bash
python main.py
```

### Method 2: From Source Directory
```bash
cd src/Main
python engines.py
```

## Game Controls
- Key A: Rotate the battleship counter-clockwise
- Key D: Rotate the battleship clockwise  
- Spacebar: Fire a bullet
- Q or ESC: Exit game

## Limitations
Now the battleship is only able to rotate and fire a bullet. There is only one asteroid coming from the left (I used it to test the code).
